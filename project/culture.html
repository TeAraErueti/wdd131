                <h2>History</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>The history of Māori culture can be divided into several distinct periods: the Archaic period (c.
                        1300 AD), characterized by the initial settlement and adaptation to New Zealand's environment;
                        the Classic period (c. 1500 AD), marked by the development of a more settled lifestyle and
                        complex social structures; and the European contact period beginning in the 18th century, which
                        brought significant changes due to colonization.
                        The Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 was a pivotal moment that aimed to protect Māori rights but led
                        to extensive land loss and cultural disruption.</p>

                <h2>Societal Structure</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Māori society is organized into iwi (tribes), hapū (sub-tribes), and whānau (extended families).
                        Each iwi has its own unique history, traditions, and governance structures.
                        The concepts of mana (authority or prestige) and whakapapa (genealogy) are fundamental to social
                        organization, influencing relationships and community dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Language</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Te reo Māori is one of New Zealand's official languages and is integral to cultural identity.
                        Efforts have been made since the late 20th century to revitalize the language through education
                        initiatives such as Kura Kaupapa Māori schools, promoting its use in everyday life.</p>

                <h2>Cultural Practices</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Māori culture is expressed through various traditional arts including whakairo (carving), raranga
                        (weaving), kapa haka (performing arts), and tā moko (tattooing).
                        Each art form carries deep significance, often reflecting ancestral stories, spiritual beliefs,
                        and social status.
                        The haka, a traditional war dance that has gained international recognition through sports teams
                        like the All Blacks, exemplifies this expressive cultural heritage.</p>

                <h2>Tikanga Māori</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Tikanga refers to the customs and values that guide behavior within Māori society.
                        These include respect for elders (kaumātua), communal living practices during significant events
                        at marae (meeting grounds), and adherence to protocols such as pōwhiri (welcoming ceremonies).
                        The principles of tapu (sacredness) and utu (reciprocity) also play crucial roles in maintaining
                        balance within relationships.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The relationship between Māori people and their land is profound. As tangata whenua (“people of
                        the land”), they hold a deep spiritual connection with their environment.
                        Concepts like kaitiakitanga emphasize guardianship over natural resources, highlighting
                        responsibilities toward sustainability.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>In recent decades, there has been a resurgence in Māori cultural pride and activism aimed at
                        addressing historical injustices stemming from colonization.
                        Movements advocating for te reo revitalization, land rights restitution through the Waitangi
                        Tribunal process, and greater representation in government reflect ongoing efforts to reclaim
                        sovereignty and promote cultural heritage.</p>
